						 I am a 20y living in Paris. I would describe myself as curious, creative and motivated. I always like to explore new ideas and give my all to everything I do. Iâ€™m sensitive and empathetic, appreciating kindness and understanding in my relationships. I strive for excellence and thrive on challenges that help me grow. Respect, optimism and kindness are some of my core values, which shape the way I see the world and connect with others.
